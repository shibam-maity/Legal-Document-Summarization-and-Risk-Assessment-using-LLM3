# Agile Document of the Project
# AI-Powered Legal Document Summarization & Risk Assessment System
 
## 1. Project Overview

### Objective & Goals

The project aims to develop an **AI-powered system for efficiently summarizing legal documents and conducting comprehensive risk assessments** using **LLMs, advanced NLP models, and vector databases**. This intelligent system automates **clause extraction, regulatory compliance verification, anomaly detection, and legal risk identification**, significantly enhancing accuracy, speed, and reliability in document processing while reducing manual effort.

### Problem Statement & Significance

Manual legal document review is **time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive**. Identifying **non-compliance risks, critical clauses, and legal conflicts** requires expertise and extensive reading. This project automates these tasks using **AI-powered summarization, clause matching, and risk assessment**, improving accuracy and efficiency.

### Challenges in Manual Document Review

- **Volume of documents:** Large legal contracts take days to analyze.
- **Human error:** Risk of missing critical clauses.
- **Compliance tracking:** Ensuring adherence to **GDPR & HIPAA regulations**.
- **Clause comparison:** Identifying discrepancies across multiple contracts.

### Need for an AI-Based Automated System

- **Reduces manual workload** by summarizing documents within seconds.
- **Enhances risk identification** using AI-powered clause matching.
- **Ensures legal compliance** by fetching real-time legal clauses.
- **Automates reporting** via **SendGrid email integration**.

## 2. System Architecture & Workflow

### System Components & Data Flow

- **Frontend:** Built using **Streamlit** for an intuitive, user-friendly experience.
- **Backend:** Implements **LangChain for text processing, Hugging Face models for NLP, and FAISS for vector search, Groq models API for summary and other processes**.
- **Database:** Uses **FAISS for semantic search and vector-based clause matching**.

### Workflow & Processing Steps

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload PDFs containing legal documents.
2. **Preprocessing & Chunking**: Text is extracted, cleaned, and split into smaller segments.
3. **AI Summarization**: LLM models generate concise summaries.
4. **Risk Assessment**: AI detects potential risks and non-compliance issues.
5. **Clause Matching**: The system fetches legal clauses from real-time web sources and compares them against uploaded documents to ensure compliance and identify key legal provisions.
6. **Document Comparisons**: The system performs document-to-document comparisons, detecting inconsistencies, missing clauses, and discrepancies across multiple contracts to maintain uniformity and accuracy.
7. **MapReduce for Chunking & Faster Processing**: Implements a distributed processing approach to efficiently handle large legal documents by splitting them into smaller, manageable chunks and enabling parallel AI processing for faster insights.
8. **Email Automation**: Processed documents and reports are sent via **SendGrid** for seamless delivery to users.
